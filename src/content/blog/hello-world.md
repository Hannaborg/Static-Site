# Hello World - My First Blog Post

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a demonstration of how blog posts work on this site. Each post is written in Markdown and automatically converted to HTML.

## Markdown Features

This post demonstrates various Markdown features:

### Text Formatting

You can write text in **bold**, *italic*, or ***both***. You can also add [links](https://example.com) and create lists:

- Unordered list item 1
- Unordered list item 2
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

1. Ordered list item 1
2. Ordered list item 2

### Code Blocks

You can add code blocks like this:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### Quotes

> This is a blockquote. You can use it to highlight important information or quotes from other sources.

## Conclusion

This is just a sample post to show you how blog posts work on this site. Feel free to modify this template for your own posts!
